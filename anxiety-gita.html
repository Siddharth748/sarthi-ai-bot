    <main>
        <p>In our fast-paced modern world, feelings of anxiety and stress are incredibly common. We often feel overwhelmed by uncertainty and the pressures of daily life. While many people turn to traditional methods for relief, the ancient wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita offers a profound and spiritual approach to finding inner peace.</p>

        <h2>The Root of Anxiety: Focusing on the Future</h2>
        <p>The Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna, teaches that much of our suffering comes from focusing on the outcomes of our actions rather than the actions themselves. Arjuna was filled with anxiety about the outcome of the battle ahead. Krishna's first lesson was to guide him to perform his duty without attachment to the results.</p>

        <p>This teaching is incredibly relevant today. When we are consumed by worry about future eventsâ€”whether it's a job interview, a difficult conversation, or an uncertain outcomeâ€”we are creating anxiety for ourselves. The Gita encourages us to do our best and surrender the results to a higher power.</p>

        <h2>Karma Yoga: The Path of Action Without Attachment</h2>
        <p>Krishna's core teaching, known as Karma Yoga, is the practice of selfless action. He says, **"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your action."**</p>
        <p>To apply this to anxiety, focus on what you can control: your effort, your intentions, and your actions. If you're anxious about an exam, focus on studying well. If you're worried about a presentation, focus on preparing thoroughly. By shifting your focus from the result to the action, you free your mind from the burden of future outcomes.</p>

        <h2>The Power of a Higher Connection</h2>
        <p>Beyond action, the Gita also offers solace through a spiritual connection. By developing a relationship with a higher power, we learn to trust that we are not alone in our struggles. Krishna reassures Arjuna, **"I am the origin of all spiritual and material worlds... everything emanates from Me."**</p>
        <p>This spiritual perspective helps put our problems into a larger context. It teaches us to let go of fear and trust in a divine plan, which is a powerful antidote to anxiety.</p>
