        <h1>Sarathi AI ‚Äì Our Story üôè</h1>
        
        <div class="story">
            <p>Sarathi AI was not created by a team of engineers or a tech giant. It was born from the journey of a simple, educated man who, like many of us, found himself in a time of deep struggle, confusion, and depression.</p>
            <p>In those moments, when neither parents, friends, nor family could provide the clarity he was seeking, he turned ‚Äî almost reluctantly ‚Äî towards religion. He was not a firm believer at the time, but something led him to open the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
            <p>The words of Shri Krishna resonated deeply. Yet, there was a challenge: How could these timeless teachings be understood in the context of today‚Äôs fast-paced, stressful world? How could one translate spiritual wisdom into real-world application?</p>
            <p>That question became the seed of Sarathi AI.</p>
            <p>Built not with complex codes or technical jargon, but with the intention to simplify ‚Äî Sarathi AI was created to make the wisdom of the Gita free, accessible, and relevant for modern life. Just as Krishna guided Arjuna through his doubts, Sarathi AI aims to guide people through daily struggles ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs stress, decision-making, relationships, or finding clarity of mind.</p>
            <p>At its heart, Sarathi AI is more than a product. It is a companion, a guide, and a source of calm strength in a noisy world.</p>
            <p>Because sometimes, what we need is not just answers. We need a Sarathi.</p>
